Timed  Quiz

## Description
The goal of this project is to create a quiz with a timer that allows a user to go through the quiz with a set amount of time (75 seconds). As the user progresses through each question, the timer will change if they select a wrong answer by reducing the  time left to complete the remaining questions. If the user makes it through all five questions before the time runs out, they have a chance of making it to the high scores list by entering their initials. If not, the user may still have a chance if there is not already a saved score. 

Additionally, this project utilizes local storage to hold the user's information from the submitted high score. This is a useful feature because it is like a game that will store the same information.
